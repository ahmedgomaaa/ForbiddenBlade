## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.imgur.com/mg5wugw.jpeg)

Forbidden Blade is a powerful tool that grants you unprecedented insight into the inner workings of the League Client's LCU (League Client Update) layer. This tool is a resurrection and enhancement of the original "Netherblade," which was unfortunately lost to the annals of the internet.

With Forbidden Blade, you can peer behind the curtain, observing requests executed by the LCU layer, unraveling the intricacies of the League of Legends client. This includes scrutinizing the RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) traffic, examining both requests and responses, and exploring the various endpoints that facilitate communication within the client.

It's essential to note that I am not the creator of this tool but rather a passionate advocate for sharing valuable resources within the community. My goal is to make this tool accessible to others who are eager to delve into the depths of the League Client's operations, just as the original Netherblade once allowed.
